This is a sliding picture puzzle made in JavaScript, HTML, CSS using stock photos of office workers. The idea is to slide the randomized tiles into the correct spaces using the one empty grid space. The game is played on a four by four game board and this version will include a timer for 60 seconds and the slide function will be directed by the arrow keys.

AAU I long for the days of a simple picture puzzle on a 10 hour car ride, so lets do that but with comical stock photos

AAU I want to be able to drag and upload photos to the shuffler
