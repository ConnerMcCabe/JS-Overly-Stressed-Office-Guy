this is the README for my 2048
2048 is a sliding block puzzle game where the objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them (only matching numbers can be combined) to create a tile with the number 2048. The game is played on a four by four game board and this version will include a timer for 60 seconds and the board tilt will be directed by the arrow keys. This iteration was made with JavaScript, HTML, CSS

AAU I wanted to have a retro experience while playing a classic minimalist game.
